# Covid-Quiz
Our Covid-Quiz Game Project in C is a console based application created using C programming language. This system is a simple mini project 
compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler. In this project, the user/player is asked a series of questions. In this quiz game, the 
questions are chosen to encompass all aspects of a traditional quiz competition. Our program firstly provides detailed information about 
the Covid-19 pandemic, covering most of its aspects: its nature, its symptoms, and proper safety measures to be taken according to the
guidelines provided by the WHO. It then asks the user multiple choice questions based upon the information provided. Each correct answer 
leads to the user securing points. It hence is a stimulating method of spreading awareness during the crises times.
